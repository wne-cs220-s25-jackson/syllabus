## Appeals

You may appeal a score that you believe is erroneous by emailing your
instructor. In your email, include the following information:

* Your full name.
* The course and section.
* The assignment, exam, or quiz in question.
* The question(s) or part that you are concerned about.
* A brief description of the problem and why you think the score is incorrect.

Appeals for a particular score must be made within 1 week of that score
being posted to Kodiak or by 9a the day grades are due, whichever is earlier.
