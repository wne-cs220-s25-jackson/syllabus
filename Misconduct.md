## Academic Misconduct

Any action that undermines the instructor's ability to assess a student's understanding or undermines the educational objective of an assignment, quiz, or exam may be considered academic misconduct and may result in penalties including reduced scores or expulsion. Examples of academic misconduct include distributing solutions, copying solutions, and redistributing course materials such as exams, quizzes, and homework assignments. Incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the chair who will determine an appropriate penalty.

All work submitted by a student must be their own work. Copying answers from another source without citation is plagiarism and academic misconduct, regardless of the source or the means of copying. Examples of sources may be: books, articles, websites, code repositories, blog posts, classmates, family members, and AI services. Examples of means of copying include: making a digital copy, digitally copying-and-pasting, transcribing from a video or someone giving dictation, and transcribing what you see. Also, paraphrasing and summarizing the ideas and structure of a source without a citation may also be plagiarism.

Just because an answer is properly cited may not be sufficient to earn a passing score on an assignment or exam. For example, if you are asked to make a case for adopting a new technology based on Agile principles, asking an AI service to generate an answer and then providing that answer and citing it avoids plagiarism, but also avoids the point of the assignment: for you to create a convincing argument and demonstrate your understanding of Agile principles -- and you may receive a 0 for such a response.

To avoid plagiarism and academic misconduct, cite your sources.
To also avoid poor scores, produce your own work.

If you are in doubt about whether an act may be considered academic misconduct or result in a reduced score, ask your instructor before committing the act.
