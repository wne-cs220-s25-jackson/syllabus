## Privacy

We'll be using a number of online tools, and some make account
information (e.g., username) public. Your instructor will do their best
to let you know when their is a chance that your information may become
public.

To protect your information, you may want to use emails and account names
that obfuscate your real name. For example, you may want to create an
email account that you will use specially for this course and create
accounts using this email. You may choose usernames that have made up
names. That is fine. All we ask is that you keep the names clean and
friendly.

Your instructor may require you to provide them with account names so
that they can grant it special permissions and so that your work under
that account can be attributed to you in the class.

Please respect the privacy of others in this class when working in a
potentially public environment by only referring to others by their
chosen account name and not their real name.

Here is a list of considerations when using some of the tools we will be
using in class.

* Commits and commit messages pushed to a public Git repository will
  become public. Commit messages contain a name and an email that you
  set when configuring Git.
* In GitLab and GitHub, when you interact with a project or group
  (e.g., creating an issue, commenting on an issue, forking a project, etc.),
  your GitLab account name will become associated with that project or group.
  If that GitLab project or group is public, then that association may
  also become public.
