## Assessment

- 40% Homework (About 5 assignments; 1 every 2-3 weeks)
- 60% Exams (3 @ 20% each)

### Grading Scale

The following scale is used to map overall scores to letter grades. The top is
the minimum overall percentage needed to earn the letter grade below. Overall
scores are rounded to the nearest percent before converting to a letter grade.

0, 60, 67, 70, 73, 77, 80, 83, 87, 90, 93
F, D, D+, C-, C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A

### Exams

Exams assess your knowledge of concepts, terminology, and their correct
application. Each exam primarily covers the material since the last exam.

### Assignments

Assignments are to be completed individually unless an assignment
explicitly states otherwise. These assignments will be used to deepen
your knowledge and assess your ability to apply your knowledge.

Each assignment is graded using a **9-point rubric**; 3-points in each
of three categories.

* Submission - Submitted on-time and is organized as directed.
* Completeness - A reasonable attempt was made on all questions.
* Correctness - Clearly demonstrates understanding of relevant material.

These categories are not entirely independent of each other. If you skip a
significant part of the homework, you may lose points in both
completeness and correctness.

Just by correctly submitting your work on time and making a
reasonable attempt on all parts, you will earn no less than a 6/9 (66.66%).

Notice you don't have to be perfect to get full credit, so long as your
work demonstrates clear understanding of the material. I only dock points
when I beleive there is a gap in your understanding of key concepts.

FYI, the 9-point scale nicely maps to letter grades as follows:

* 9/9 = 100% = A+
* 8/9 = 88.88% = B+
* 7/9 = 77.77% = C+
* 6/9 = 66.66% = D+ (after rounding)
* 5/9 = 55.55% = F

### Late Work

Unless an assignment explicitly states otherwise, the following policies
apply.

Work is ***due by 9 AM ET*** on the day it is scheduled due (usually Monday).

If submitting homework late, the following policy applies. You may submit
work up to 72 hours late without penalty. This is called the **grace period**.
After the grace period, your work will be accepted up to 1 week from the
original deadline, but will receive no more than 55%. Work later than 1 week
will not be accepted and will receive a 0. On the 9 point rubric,
you will loose 1 point in the *submission* category, and 3 points in
*correctness* and no critical feed back is given. It is possible to earn
less if the submission is incomplete or is submitted such that it hinders
grading (i.e., it does not follow submission guidelines).

The purpose of the grace period is to allow for any unavoidable, last-minute
problems that prevent you from getting your work in on time. It also
gives you enough time to get the help you need to resolve the mater.
**Additional extensions beyond this grace period will not be granted.**

Quizzes and exams must be completed on time, otherwise they receive a 0.
