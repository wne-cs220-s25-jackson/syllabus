## Student Accessibility Services

I am committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design.
If you encounter barriers, please let me know immediately so we can
determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made. I am happy
to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the
intent of the assessment or learning activity. If you have a disability,
or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with
Student Accessibility Services. The contact information is listed below:

    Student Accessibility Services
    Herman Hall, SAS Suite 105
    Office Phone: 413-782-1258
    Email: accessibility@wne.edu

Once I have a copy of your approved accommodations from SAS we can plan
a time to connect to discuss your accommodation needs. In addition,
if you are approved for exam accommodations, please consult with me at
least two weeks before any scheduled exam date to confirm the testing
arrangements.
